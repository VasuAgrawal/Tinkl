          <p align="justify">
            Tinkl is a health monitoring system spread out across the city that uses information from lavatory usage to allow individuals to keep tabs on their health on the go, and to allow the city to be apprised of the collective health of the city's population. 
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Our device integrates color, temperature, and turbidity sensors into an unobtrusive package that can operate in the messy environment of a urinal, sensing key properties of urine and transmitting an analysis of the data to individuals on demand, as well as to city authorities for centralized monitoring of a city's collective health.

        <div class="text">
          <p align="justify">
            Currently, individuals do not have easy access to basic measures of their health such as temperature on the go; at the present moment, cities do not also have an effective means to track with frequency, the collective health of the city's population.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">Our project aims to remedy this, by creating a small and cost-effective package that can be unobtrusively distributed around a city's many lavatories, and which can sense a person's health markers from a trip to the lavatory, making it easy for a person to keep tabs on his health anywhere and anytime, and allowing for the city's collective health to be monitored in real time.

        </div>
		<div class="text">
		  Our systems are designed to allow people to increase awareness of their health, by enhancing the accessibility of key health markers available in urine. We envision several possible use cases for this system:
		  <ul>
			<li> Similar to <a href="http://www.hydralert.com/">Hydralert's</a> concept, our system can enhance workplace safety. 
In industries necessitating outdoor activity, this can allow workers to be aware of markers such as their body temperature and hydration levels, and adjust their water intake accordingly to ensure that they do not suffer the adverse effects of heat stroke or other heat and hydration-related ailments.
Employers will be able to monitor their employees overall hydration and health markers, and respond accordingly to encourage better employee health and safety while on the job.</li>
			<li>Our system also provides a means for individuals to be more cognizant of their health. In urban areas where our system is ubiquitous, an individual's health information can be easily analyzed, and will be collated and made available in an easily understandable format at the touch of a button.</li>

          <p align="justify">
Based on our design requirements, our lavatory health monitoring system has two
primary users and end-goals in mind: to help individuals gain easy access to
health monitoring city-wide, and to enable monitoring of the city's collective
health through distributed urinalysis. System-wide, our architecture will adopt
a hub-and-spoke model, with multiple sensing nodes in each bathroom (urinal
pucks) connecting to a local bathroom-level server/gateway which performs
analysis and interacts with individuals requesting personal health data, and
which also funnels data to a central city server.
          </p>
<img src="files/arch1.png" style="width:100%;" align="middle">

<p align="justify">
In order to gather data, the user will urinate into the urinal. The puck will
collect this urine passively and will be woken up by the presence of urine. Once
woken up, it will begin sensing and data collection and stream its results to
the hub located in the bathroom. The hub will aggregate data from multiple pucks
and periodically send it to the city-wide server for further processing. A user
can also connect to the local hub to gather basic analytics and data after
indicating their desire to receive such data.

Our system uses a number of different technologies to facilitate all of the
communication between different components. Below we've detailed the methods by
which each component will talk to each other component. For simplicity, only one
puck and hub are drawn, though the communication technologies between the pucks
and hub, as well as those between hubs and central server, trivially scale to
multiple connected devices. In short, the puck communicates with all of its
various sensors through either an I2C ADC or directly over I2C. The puck
transmits its data to the hub over an I2C radio, which then forwards the
information to the server via WiFi.
